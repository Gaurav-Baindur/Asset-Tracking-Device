# Asset-Tracking-Device
Rural areas in India have obvious connectivity issues due to the lack of proper and distinct roads. This makes the delivery of goods, in this case vehicles, is difficult. To help ease the logistical nightmare of delivering vehicles on time to rural areas, a simple tracking system ito hel improve the delivery system used by the company. This device can track the supply vehicle without GPS signals as well, although this is not the focus of the project. The foucs here is track the vehicle and collect important information about the route and process followed when deilvering goods to remote areas. This would espesially useful in hard to reach markets like rural areas and distant villages.

Data is collected on-prem using an SD-Card and data once logged can be sent using a GSM or WiFi module, as long as device is in signal range. Data not sent, will be sent once the device is in range. The data collected either on-prem or in the cloud can be used to improve the logistics and the system of delivery used. As accessability and the environment to different remote areas vary drastically, collecting data about the route, environmental conditions and so on will help in establishing a consistant logistcal system for smooth and timely delivery of vehicles and other goods. This data can also be used to help curb last mile connectivity issues faced by people to help build the correct type of infrastrucutre suited to that particular area and environment.
